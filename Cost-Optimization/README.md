IDEDNTIFYING THE STALE SNAPSHOTS

IN THIS EXAMPLE WE'LL CREATE A LAMBDA FUNCTION THAT IDENTIFIES EBS SNAPSHOTS THAT ARE NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ACTIVE EC2-INSTANCES AND DELETES THEM TO SAVE THE STORAGE COST

DESCRIPTION:
THE LAMBDA FUCNCTION FETECHES ALL EBS SNAPSHOSTS OF THE SAME ACCOUNT AND RETRIVES THE ACTIVE LIST OF EC2-INSTANCES. FOR EACH SNAPSHOT IT CHECK IF ASSOCIATED VOLUME IS NOT ASSCOCIATED WITH ANY ACTIVE INSTANCES, IF IT FINDS A STALE SNAPSHOT, IT DELETES IT, EFFECTIVELY OPTIMIZING STORAGE COST.
